# Weight-Tracker-PoC-Angular
Angular (v18) front-end experiment with Bootstrap and browser local storage (HTML5).

`npm start` runs the application _(assuming you have the required tools installed, including Node Package Manager of course)._

# Implementation goals (most are still ToDo)

* User will use the app on a desktop (webapp)
* User can enter their weight on a daily basis
* User can add a description with each weight entry
* User can see the development of their weight
* User can set a target weight / goal
* User can see the progress towards their goal
